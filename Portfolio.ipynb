        "# Von Simmons' Portfolio\n",
        "Welcome traveler! Here you can find projects I have developed during my studies as an Electrical Engineering student. Projects cover topics in the fields of mechanical design, software, control systems, machine learning, and electrical design. They are chosen as a supplement to my formal studies at University. Please let me know if you have any questions. Enjoy!\n",

        "### 1. Legacy Robotics (2022 - 2024)\n",
        "\n",
        "Legacy Robotics USA is a registered nonprofit I founded, starting in June 2022. It is a university engineering team for the competition Robomaster in North America (RMNA). Being the first RMNA team at UC Irvine, I wore many hats ranging from engineering, to business and marketing, and even accounting. I wrote proposals, recruited members, trained members, and much more. My hope was to test my understanding of robotics and to develop crucial leadership skills. There is far too much to describe in a brief summary. More information is available on request.\n",

        "### 2. Inverted Pendulum on Cart\n",
        "\n",
        "The classic control theory test is balancing an inverted pendulum. I took on the challenge to learn about several things including state-space control and mechanical design. Through many hours of tuning I gained a deep appreciation for the mathematics of control. Despite its short-comings, I wish to present this project to you because of the sheer willpower it took to bring it into existence. What you see below is roughly 9 weeks of late nights, working my hardest to implement state-space control, nonlinear Lyapunov control, mechanical design, ODrive motor driver, software (C/C++, Python, Bash), and electrical design.\n",

        "### 3. Research: Slothbot\n",
        "\n",
        "The Slothbot is a research project under Magnus Egerstedt, Dean of Engineering at UC Irvine. This project in particular is the 3rd edition in a line of Slothbots beginning in the GRITS lab at Georgia Tech. The goal is for it to perform long-duration environmental monitoring while traversing a high-wire. Below, you will find documentation of a complex software-electrical system which allows the Slothbot to hibernate and conserve power for long periods of time. It involves an onboard computer, on board microcontroller, and base-station computer which communicates with a server. It builds on my understanding of full-stack websites, IoT devices, and mobile robots.\n",

        "### 4. Tactile Sensor Experiment\n",
        "\n",
        "Robotics has traditionally been a control field. Many of the algorithms are based on optimization which attempt to tightly control trajectories. More recently machine learning has made its way onto the scene. This project serves 2 purposes:\n",
        "\n",
        "(A) To study machine learning. Particularly YOLOv5 (computer vision) and tabular prediction via a single layer deep neural network.\n",
        "\n",
        "(B) To attempt creating a rudimentary tactile sensor which would allow a robotic manipulator to sense an object it is grasping.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project demonstrates a complex stack of technology. Not only is the final system multilayered, but it also features a complex construction process. More information is available in the documentation link. Please feel free to enquire further.\n",
