# Research Portfolio – Von Simmons

## Overview
I am an electrical engineer passionate about developing hardware-based approaches for adaptive, self-organizing computation. This portfolio highlights projects that reflect my trajectory from robotics and control to neuromorphic and complex adaptive systems.

## Featured Projects (6 Projects)
1. **[Inverted Pendulum (LQR + Lyapunov)](https://github.com/vs65497/InvertedPendulum/blob/main/README.md)**

    This project was my introduction to state-space control theory, centered on the classical challenge of stabilizing an inverted pendulum. Over approximately nine weeks, I independently implemented a working system that combined nonlinear Lyapunov control and state-space feedback on custom-built hardware. The project involved full-stack engineering: mechanical design, ODrive-based motor control, embedded software in C/C++, and scripting in Python and Bash.

    *Skills:* Control theory, embedded systems, motor control, mechanism design (SolidWorks, CSWA), dynamics.

2. **[RoboMaster Competition Team](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XCVgsTe5O8)**  

    In June 2022, I founded a RoboMaster competition team. As team lead, I wore many hats ranging from engineering, to business and marketing, and accounting. I wrote grant proposals, recruited members, trained members, and so forth. The team remains active and continues to grow.

   *Skills:* Systems design & integration, mechanism design (OnShape), project management.

3. **[Tactile Sensor with ML Pipeline](https://github.com/vs65497/Tactile-Sensor)**  

    Designed a tactile sensing module and implemented a PyTorch classifier pipeline for contact force inference. Goals of this project were:
    - To study machine learning. Particularly YOLOv5 (computer vision) and tabular prediction via a single hidden-layer deep neural network.
    - To create a prototype sensing pipeline which would allow a robotic manipulator to model grasped objects.
  
    *Skills:* Sensor design, machine learning.

4. **[Optimization & Reinforcement Learning Experiments](https://github.com/vs65497/Optimizers/blob/main/OptSummary.ipynb)**  

    Implemented LP and QP solvers, forward-mode auto-differentiation, and tested policy-based control scenarios (Frozen Lake with Reinforcement Learning).  
  
    *Skills:* Optimization, Python, numerical methods.

5. **[Coordinated Control of Multi-Robot Systems](https://github.com/vs65497/Swarm-Coordinated-Control)** (Reproduction study)  

    Reproduced key dynamics of multi-robot coordination in simulation. Original work from Jorge Cortés & Magnus Egerstedt (2017). 
  
    *Skills:* Graph theory, Python.

6. **[Emergent brain-like complexity from nanowire atomic switch networks](https://github.com/vs65497/Portfolio/#)** (Independent reproduction study of Kuncic et al.; WIP)  

    Attempted to reproduce the findings of Kuncic et al. using a simulation of an Ag₂S nanowire network and low-voltage input signal.  
  
    *Skills:* Graph theory, C++/Python.
