# Research Portfolio – Von Simmons

## Overview
I am an electrical engineer passionate about developing hardware-based approaches for adaptive, self-organizing computation. This portfolio highlights projects that reflect my trajectory from robotics and control to neuromorphic and complex adaptive systems.

## Featured Projects (6 Projects)
1. **[Inverted Pendulum (LQR + Lyapunov)](https://github.com/vs65497/InvertedPendulum/blob/main/README.md)**, 2022

    Independently implemented an inverted pendulum which combined a nonlinear Lyapunov controller (to swing the pendulum to its up-position) and a state-space LQR controller to regulate at the balanced position. The rig was designed, built, and tuned in one-shot, on a 9-week deadline. The project involved full-stack engineering: electro-mechanical design, ODrive motor control, embedded software in C/C++, and scripting in Python and Bash.

    *Skills:* Control theory, embedded systems, motor control, mechanism design (SolidWorks, CSWA), dynamics.

2. **[RoboMaster Competition Team](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XCVgsTe5O8)**, 2022-2024  

    Founded a RoboMaster competition team (2022). Performed multiple roles including engineering and design, business and marketing, accounting. Wrote grant proposals, recruited members, trained members, etc. The team remains active today.

   *Skills:* Systems design & integration, mechanism design (OnShape), project management.

3. **[Tactile Sensor with ML Pipeline](https://github.com/vs65497/Tactile-Sensor)**, 2023  

    Designed a tactile sensing module and implemented a PyTorch classifier pipeline for contact force inference. Goals of this project were:
    - To study machine learning. Particularly YOLOv5 (computer vision) and tabular prediction via a single hidden-layer deep neural network.
    - To create a prototype sensing pipeline which would allow a robotic manipulator to model grasped objects.
  
    *Skills:* Sensor design, machine learning.

4. **[Optimization Experiments](https://github.com/vs65497/Optimizers/blob/main/OptSummary.ipynb)**, 2022  

    Implemented LP and QP solvers, forward-mode auto-differentiation, and tested policy-based control scenarios.  
  
    *Skills:* Optimization, Python, numerical methods.

5. **[Coordinated Control of Multi-Robot Systems](https://github.com/vs65497/Swarm-Coordinated-Control)**, 2022 (Reproduction study)  

    Reproduced key dynamics of multi-robot coordination in simulation. Original work from Jorge Cortés & Magnus Egerstedt (2017). 
  
    *Skills:* Graph theory, Python.

6. **[Emergent brain-like complexity from nanowire atomic switch networks](https://github.com/vs65497/Portfolio/#)**, 2025 (Independent reproduction study of Kuncic et al.; WIP)  

    Reproduced memory retention in a simulation of an Ag₂S nanowire network (atomic-switch network). Original work from Kuncic, et al. (2018).  
  
    *Skills:* Circuit theory, C++/Python.
